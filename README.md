# NAVEL - Logistics Innovation Center

Any country requires home grown solutions to solve problems faced by different stake holders of the society of those countries. One such area is in finding solutions to problems in ensuring the safety of food during transporting. The ideas and easy-to-use technology that is associated with the Internet of Things (IoT) enable developing cost-effective solutions to many such problems. NAVEL is the name given to a project funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) of Germany to build Logistics Innovation Center in Cameroon. The aim of the project is to build a "Fab Lab" with computing hardware and the know-how, available to entrepreneurs to try out new ideas and tehnological solutions required in their businesses.

To demonstrate the possibilities of the Fab Lab, we have built simple IoT solutions for some selected use cases and the related problems. This repostory provides the details of these solutions in terms of the protypes developed and the training material required to build such protoypes.

We hope that this will inspire the users of the Fab Lab to find solutions to their problems.

The different sections of this repository is organized in the following manner.

- [Training Material](./training-material) - This sections provides a number of HOWTOs on using the technologies of the IoT to find solutions to problems.
- [Prototypes](./prototypes) - This section provides details of the different protoypes developed to show the possibilities of the Fab Lab.
